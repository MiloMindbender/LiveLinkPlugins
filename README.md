# LiveLink Plugins for Bliss tracker and Unreal Engine

## These docs are being updated for Release 3 which should be available in a few days.

This plugin brings Bliss camera tracking data into Unreal's LiveLink system.  To use it you need a Bliss tracker from [Rassi Engineering LTD](https://www.retracker.co/)

These documents are easier to read on the [github site](https://github.com/MiloMindbender/LiveLinkPlugins) so all the clickable links work.

I am not an employee of Bliss/Rassi Engineering LTD.  I developed this Plugin to learn LiveLink, something which Epic/Unreal has almost no documentation on.  This comes with no warrantees or guarantees expressed or implied. Try it and decide for yourself if they work for your purposes.  Please report ANY problems to the github issues page [here](https://github.com/MiloMindbender/LiveLinkPlugins/issues)  Feel free to use this code as an example if you need to write a LiveLink Plugin.

# Quick Install (DO NOT use the green CODE button)

Please follow the [install instructions here](INSTALLATION.md) Troubleshooting help is [here](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)

The green CODE button is NOT WHAT YOU WANT.  It will give you a work in progress version for experimenters and colaborators that requires compiling and may not be stable.  If you want to hack on my code, [instructions are here](SOURCE_CODE.md)

The latest release of the plugin and related tools will always be available on [releases page here](https://github.com/MiloMindbender/LiveLinkPlugins/releases)

## Important note

If you have been using Bliss for awhile, your projects may have it set to run through FreeD.  You will want to change this to use LiveLink.  The sample project is setup this way as an example.  See Bliss documentations on the settings file for how to setup RETracker Bliss.

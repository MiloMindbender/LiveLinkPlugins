# LiveLinkPlugins

This contains 4 different plugins, all of them are beta and can't be trusted, they are here for test purposes only!!

You should not use any of this in a production project or even as a reference on how to write a good LiveLink plugin as nothing here is finished and may have bad bugs!

# BlissTracker

First attempt at LiveLink, didn't work right here only for reference

# LiveLinkBliss 

Second attempt, not ready to use yet, being worked on.  This one is based on the Unreal FreeD plugin source because it fixed the problems I experienced in BlissTracker.  Unfortunately, since there is no documentation on ANY of the livelink functions I had to start from something known working and guess at what changes were needed

# LiveLinkFreeDE

This is the Epic LiveLinkFreeD plugin from the unreal repo, here only for reference purposes, it is unchanged.

# UniversalRig

This is a plugin with some parts used to adjust the relationship between camera and tracker.  Eventually this will be unnecessary as all this will be handled automatically by the UE lens file and calibrator.
